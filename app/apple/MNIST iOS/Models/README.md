#  Tensorflow Models

This folder contains the model file used by tensorflow lite to perform image recognition.
Due to the size and the binary nature of the model, the model is not uploaded to git. Please 
follow instructions at the root read me to generate the tensorflow model.

When you are done, there should be a `quantized-model.tfmodel` file in this directory.
